# Password Management System
Today, many of us are forced to come up with new passwords all the time when signing into sites and apps. As a password inventeur it is our responsibility to come up with good, hard-to-crack passwords. But it is also in the interest of sites and apps to make sure that you use good passwords.
  It's really hard to define what makes a good password. However, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) knows what the second best thing is: To make sure you're at least not using a bad password. We will go through the passwords of users from a fictional company and use R to flag the users with bad passwords.
  
  Verifiers SHALL store memorized secrets in a form that is resistant to offline attacks. Memorized secrets SHALL be salted and hashed using a suitable one-way key derivation function.
